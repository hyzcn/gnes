People with jobs must, as a rule, make payments to four parts of the system, for health insurance, long-range nursing care, pensions and unemployment. These payments will usually come to about 40% of gross income, but the employer normally pays half of the cost, meaning that the employee is out of pocket only just 20% of his income. Other pillars of the social security program are company accident insurance, paid for completely by the employer, and social indemnity, which the state handles.

The premiums depend on income. The greater it is the more must be paid, up to a certain limit. In 2019, the premium is about 14.6% of gross income for the national health insurance, the exact amount depending on the insuring company. Premiums are paid on income up to €54,450 per year (€4,538) monthly). For long-range nursing care insurance the payment is 3.05% or 3.3% on monthly income up to €4,538 (€54,450 per year). The monthly premium can reach a maximum of about €150/month. The 2019 yearly income limits for pension and unemployment insurance are €80,400 in the former West Germany and €73,800 in the former East Germany. The charges are 18.6% for pension insurance and 2.5% for unemployment insurance.

Health insurance. About 85% of the German population is insured under the Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung (GKV), the German version of a national health system. It covers such things as hospital stays, dental care, routine doctor visits, drugs, eyeglasses, immunizations and x-rays. It also compensates persons for loss of income due to illness.

Employed persons making more than €5,063 monthly (€60,750 per year) have the option of either remaining in the statutory health insurance plan or taking out private insurance. The employer still may, with certain limitations, pay up to half the premiums of the private insurance plan. Self-employed persons can, under certain circumstances, also be insured under the statutory plan, or they may take out private insurance regardless of their income.

As Black Friday looms in the near future and the holiday rush kicks into full swing, I thought I would join the call of those wishing to “keep it simple”, but with a different spin. How do you keep it simple in your meetings or in the boardroom?

Those of you familiar with my approach to Robert’s Rules of Order know that my philosophy is to keep it simple. Robert’s Rules become intimidating and unworkable for most groups when the group tries to deal with the minutia of the kinds of pitched battles associated with, say, a filibuster in the U.S. Senate. Robert’s Rules is designed to handle these situations, certainly, but the details of the rules can be overkill for groups that operate on more of a consensus basis. An understanding of, and adherence to, some basic rules will serve most groups. It will also greatly aid group productivity, and it will reduce or remove the intimidation factor.
